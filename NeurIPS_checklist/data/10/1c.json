They address three specific risks: bias of the expert agent, over-reliance on the expert, and student physical constraints during learning. The authors propose future directions to address these challenges and mitigate the risks in their approach. They emphasize that their work is meant to assist human teaching rather than replace it, acknowledging the importance of various aspects of human instruction that are difficult to replicate with AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 1}, {"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the authors discuss potential negative societal impacts of their work in the \"A Broader Impact & Ethics Statement\" section of the appendix.
